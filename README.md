Yo!!! You found my GitHub page. Greetings! My name is Harrison Ma, a Senior at UCSD. I double major in Math-CompSci and Cognitive Science-Machine Learning. I love data science 
and software development and am currently looking for full time opportunities in these areas. I also work as a research assistant/bioinformatician for the Neil Chi Lab at UCSD
School of Medicine (pretty cool stuff). 

Apart from academics, I play Overwatch (a multiplayer FPS game) competitively at a collegiate level. I stream occassionally on [Twitch](twitch.tv/damocles_ow). 

Anyways, I got a pretty lame looking website at http://harrison-q-ma.github.io/. Check it out. Contact info and resume also on there.
